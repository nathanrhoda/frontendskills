# Frontendskills

Evaluating and familiarizing myself with Vue.js, React, Angular


## Outcome

Goal understand differences between the 3 different frontend technologies.
Benefits and drawbacks

# Conclusion

Personal favourtie is vue nice and compact and easy to understand and with the tendency of most components to be small having the html style and any logic tapping into lifecycles etc makes it easy to
follow and efficient to navigate. Just my personal preference.

Angular is my second favourite similar to view reason why its not number 1 is because of the amount of small files that are scattered in component folders makes for alot of clicking around other than that 
I have no complaints it along with Vue has similar feel.


I struggled abit more with React feels very different to the UI technologies I get the sense that its something thats difficult to get into in the beginning but once you work with it for a while
you will be able to knock out new things fairly quickly in this comparisons it was my least favourite of the 3.
